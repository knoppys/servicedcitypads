I came across Blinkers totally by chance and Im so glad I did. This elegent Brunch Bar in Chester City Center tailors for all. The decor brings home the real essence of its proximity to the Chester Racecourse. Its clean, spacious and welcoming, warm and friendly. Weather your looking for a sit down lunch in Chester or just a take out coffee your sure to end up with the finest and freshest ingredients on your plate. Ziggy, the man behind Blinkers treats his newcomners just as well as he treats his regulars. I regularly get my lunches and coffees and although Im close to other cafes and takeouts but, I would prefer to spend a little extra for quality and a welcoming athmosphere.
